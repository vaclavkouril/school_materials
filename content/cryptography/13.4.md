# Consider a “padded RSA” signature scheme where the public key is $\langle N, e\rangle$ as usual, and a signature on a message $m \in \{0,1\}^l$ is computed by choosing uniform $r \in \{0,1\}^{2n-1}$ and outputting $[(r||m)^d \mod N ]$.
## a. How can verification be done for this scheme?


--- 
## b. Show that this scheme is insecure.
